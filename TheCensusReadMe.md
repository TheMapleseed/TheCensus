## Enterprise Consensus Mechanism

High-performance, thread-safe consensus implementation with integrated MLS protocol support and constant-time cryptographic operations.

### Core Features

- Thread-safe consensus operations
- Constant-time cryptographic primitives
- Integrated MLS protocol support
- Memory-efficient buffer management
- Comprehensive metric collection

### Quick Start

```go
import (
    "context"
    consensus "github.com/enterprise/consensus"
)

func main() {
    cfg := &consensus.Config{
        BufferSize: 1024 * 1024,
        Security: consensus.SecurityConfig{
            EnableMLS: true,
            ConstantTime: true,
        },
    }

    core, err := consensus.NewConsensusCore(context.Background(), cfg)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("initialization failed: %v", err)
    }
    defer core.Cleanup()
}
```

### Security Considerations

- All cryptographic operations use constant-time implementations
- MLS protocol enabled by default
- Secure memory management with automatic cleanup
- Thread-safe state transitions

### Performance Notes

- Configurable buffer sizes
- Pool-based memory management
- Optimized lock-free operations where possible
- Automatic resource cleanup

### Requirements

- Go 1.22 or higher
- GOARCH: amd64, arm64
- OS: Linux, Darwin
